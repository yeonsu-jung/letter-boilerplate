abstract = {Aeronautical studies have shown that subtle changes in aerofoil shape substantially alter aerodynamic forces during fixed-wing flight. The link between shape and performance for flapping locomotion involves distinct mechanisms associated with the complex flows and unsteady motions of an air- or hydro-foil. Here, we use an evolutionary scheme to modify the cross-sectional shape and iteratively improve the speed of three-dimensional printed heaving foils in forward flight. In this algorithmic-experimental method, ‘genes' are mathematical parameters that define the shape, ‘breeding' is the combination of genes from parent wings to form a daughter, and a wing's measured speed is its ‘fitness' that dictates its likelihood of breeding. Repeated over many generations, this process automatically discovers a fastest foil whose cross-section resembles a slender teardrop. We conduct an analysis that uses the larger population to identify what features of this shape are most critical, implicating slenderness, location of maximum thickness and fore-aft asymmetries in edge sharpness or bluntness. This analysis also reveals a tendency towards extremely thin and cusp-like trailing edges. These findings demonstrate artificial evolution in laboratory experiments as a successful strategy for tailoring shape to improve propulsive performance. Such a method could be used in related optimization problems, such as tuning kinematics or flexibility for flapping propulsion, and for flow–structure interactions more generally.},

abstract = {Heavier-than-air flight at any scale is energetically expensive. This is greatly exacerbated at small scales and has so far presented an insurmountable obstacle for untethered flight in insect-sized (mass less than 500 milligrams and wingspan less than 5 centimetres) robots. These vehicles1–4 thus need to fly tethered to an offboard power supply and signal generator owing to the challenges associated with integrating onboard electronics within a limited payload capacity. Here we address these challenges to demonstrate sustained untethered flight of an insect-sized flapping-wing microscale aerial vehicle. The 90-milligram vehicle uses four wings driven by two alumina-reinforced piezoelectric actuators to increase aerodynamic efficiency (by up to 29 per cent relative to similar two-wing vehicles5) and achieve a peak lift-to-weight ratio of 4.1 to 1, demonstrating greater thrust per muscle mass than typical biological counterparts6. The integrated system of the vehicle together with the electronics required for untethered flight (a photovoltaic array and a signal generator) weighs 259 milligrams, with an additional payload capacity allowing for additional onboard devices. Consuming only 110–120 milliwatts of power, the system matches the thrust efficiency of similarly sized insects such as bees7. This insect-scale aerial vehicle is the lightest thus far to achieve sustained untethered flight (as opposed to impulsive jumping8 or liftoff9).},

abstract = {Controlled gliding is one of the most energetically efficient modes of transportation for natural and human powered fliers. Here we demonstrate that gliding and landing strategies with different optimality criteria can be identified through deep-reinforcement-learning without explicit knowledge of the underlying physics. We combine a two-dimensional model of a controlled elliptical body with deep-reinforcement-learning (D-RL) to achieve gliding with either minimum energy expenditure, or fastest time of arrival, at a predetermined location. In both cases the gliding trajectories are smooth, although energy/time optimal strategies are distinguished by small/high frequency actuations. We examine the effects of the ellipse's shape and weight on the optimal policies for controlled gliding. We find that the model-free reinforcement learning leads to more robust gliding than model-based optimal control strategies with a modest additional computational cost. We also demonstrate that the gliders with D-RL can generalize their strategies to reach the target location from previously unseen starting positions. The model-free character and robustness of D-RL suggests a promising framework for developing robotic devices capable of exploiting complex flow environments.},

abstract = {Why do animals move the way they do? Bacteria, insects, birds, and fish share with us the necessity to move so as to live. Although each organism follows its own evolutionary course, it also obeys a set of common laws. At the very least, the movement of animals, like that of planets, is governed by Newton's law: All things fall. On Earth, most things fall in air or water, and their motions are thus subject to the laws of hydrodynamics. Through trial and error, animals have found ways to interact with fluid so they can float, drift, swim, sail, glide, soar, and fly. This elementary struggle to escape the fate of falling shapes the development of motors, sensors, and mind. Perhaps we can deduce parts of their neural computations by understanding what animals must do so as not to fall. Here I discuss recent developments along this line of inquiry in the case of insect flight. Asking how often a fly must sense its orientation in order to balance in air has shed new light on the role of motor neurons and steering muscles responsible for flight stability.},

@article{Kammer1978,
abstract = {Actively flying insects achieve the highest metabolic rates known, and they do so in the fraction of a second required to shift from quiescence to flight. This chapter focuses on the various adaptations that make possible the high metabolic rates necessary for flight. Flight depends on the biochemical and mechanical work done by the flight muscles, which must be continually supplied with oxygen and fuel. The work of the muscles is under neural control and therefore the metabolic rate is also under neural control. Hormones participate as part of the biochemical mechanisms by which the neural commands are executed and also as part of the internal milieu supportive of flight. In larger insects, high metabolic rates and the associated heat production result in elevated body temperatures; temperature effects and temperature regulation are thus closely related to flight. Control of flight metabolism is accomplished by a complicated meshwork of neural, hormonal, and biochemical mechanisms. Control of the rate of metabolism is primarily neural, since the frequency of excitation of the flight muscles provides the primary control on the demand for metabolic performance. The metabolic machinery of the muscle is also influenced by these neural signals, since Ca++ released by excitation modulates enzyme activity. Hormones that control the uptake of substrates and perhaps other biochemical reactions in the muscles also influence muscle metabolism. {\textcopyright} 1978 Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd},

@article{VanRees2015,
abstract = {Undulatory locomotion is an archetypal mode of propulsion for natural swimmers across scales. Undulatory swimmers convert transverse body oscillations into forward velocity by a complex interplay between their flexural movements, morphological features and the fluid environment. Natural evolution has produced a wide range of morphokinematic examples of undulatory swimmers that often serve as inspiration for engineering devices. It is, however, unknown to what extent natural swimmers are optimized for hydrodynamic performance. In this work, we reverse-engineer the morphology and gait for fast and efficient swimmers by coupling an evolution strategy to three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of flows at intermediate Reynolds numbers. The fastest swimmer is slender with a narrow tail fin and performs a sequence of C-starts to maximize its average velocity. The most efficient swimmer combines moderate transverse movements with a voluminous head, tapering into a streamlined profile via a pronounced inflection point. These optimal solutions outperform anguilliform swimming zebrafish in both efficiency and speed. We investigate the transition between morphokinematic solutions in the speed-energy space, laying the foundations for the design of high-performance artificial swimming devices.},

abstract = {Modern robots lack the multifunctional interconnected systems found in living organisms and are consequently unable to reproduce their efficiency and autonomy. Energy-storage systems are among the most crucial limitations to robot autonomy, but their size, weight, material and design constraints can be re-examined in the context of multifunctional, bio-inspired applications. Here we present a synthetic energy-dense circulatory system embedded in an untethered, aquatic soft robot. Modelled after redox flow batteries, this synthetic vascular system combines the functions of hydraulic force transmission, actuation and energy storage into a single integrated design that geometrically increases the energy density of the robot to enable operation for long durations (up to 36 hours). The fabrication techniques and flexible materials used in its construction enable the vascular system to be created with complex form factors that continuously deform with the robot's movement. This use of electrochemical energy storage in hydraulic fluids could facilitate increased energy density, autonomy, efficiency and multifunctionality in future robot designs.},

@article{Lauder2007,
abstract = {As a result of years of research on the comparative biomechanics and physiology of moving through water, biologists and engineers have made considerable progress in understanding how animals moving underwater use their muscles to power movement, in describing body and appendage motion during propulsion, and in conducting experimental and computational analyses of fluid movement and attendant forces. But it is clear that substantial future progress in understanding aquatic propulsion will require new lines of attack. Recent years have seen the advent of one such new avenue that promises to greatly broaden the scope of intellectual opportunity available to researchers: the use of biorobotic models. In this paper we discuss, using aquatic propulsion in fishes as our focal example, how using robotic models can lead to new insights in the study of aquatic propulsion. We use two examples: (1) pectoral fin function, and (2) hydrodynamic interactions between dorsal and caudal fins. Pectoral fin function is characterized by considerable deformation of individual fin rays, as well as spanwise (along the length) and chordwise (across the fin) deformation and area change. The pectoral fin can generate thrust on both the outstroke and instroke. A robotic model of the pectoral fin replicates this result, and demonstrates the effect of altering stroke kinematics on the pattern of force production. The soft dorsal fin of fishes sheds a distinct vortex wake that dramatically alters incoming flow to the tail: the dorsal fin and caudal fin act as dual flapping foils in series. This design can be replicated with a dual-foil flapping robotic device that demonstrates this phenomenon and allows examination of regions of the flapping performance space not available to fishes. We show how the robotic flapping foil device can also be used to better understand the significance of flexible propulsive surfaces for locomotor performance. Finally we emphasize the utility of self-propelled robotic devices as a means of understanding how locomotor forces are generated, and review different conceptual designs for robotic models of aquatic propulsion.},

abstract = {Small-scale soft continuum robots capable of active steering and navigation in a remotely controllable manner hold great promise in diverse areas, particularly in medical applications. Existing continuum robots, however, are often limited to millimeter or centimeter scales due to miniaturization challenges inherent in conventional actuation mechanisms, such as pulling mechanical wires, inflating pneumatic or hydraulic chambers, or embedding rigid magnets for manipulation. In addition, the friction experienced by the continuum robots during navigation poses another challenge for their applications. Here, we present a submillimeter-scale, self-lubricating soft continuum robot with omnidirectional steering and navigating capabilities based on magnetic actuation, which are enabled by programming ferromagnetic domains in its soft body while growing hydrogel skin on its surface. The robot's body, composed of a homogeneous continuum of a soft polymer matrix with uniformly dispersed ferromagnetic microparticles, can be miniaturized below a few hundreds of micrometers in diameter, and the hydrogel skin reduces the friction by more than 10 times. We demonstrate the capability of navigating through complex and constrained environments, such as a tortuous cerebrovascular phantom with multiple aneurysms. We further demonstrate additional functionalities, such as steerable laser delivery through a functional core incorporated in the robot's body. Given their compact, self-contained actuation and intuitive manipulation, our ferromagnetic soft continuum robots may open avenues to minimally invasive robotic surgery for previously inaccessible lesions, thereby addressing challenges and unmet needs in healthcare.},
